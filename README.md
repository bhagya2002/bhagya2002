### About Me
I'm a student at the University of Alberta pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering Software Option degree. I am also currently a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador!

Currently, I am looking for summer 2022 SWE internships! Previously I was a SWE intern at DevFacto Technologies based in Edmonton, AB. I am also a member of Future Creators, a student-run non-profit organization at the university that provides resources and mentorship to young innovators to help bring their innovations to life.

I enjoy Full Stack Web Development and plan to dive into Machine Learning in the near future! On my own time, I'm exploring various Database Systems focussing on small-scale applications.  

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing sports competitively (mainly soccer), and going on hikes! </br></br>
